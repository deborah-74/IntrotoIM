# Week 2 Assignment: Loop Art

I really enjoyed this week'a assignment. Going into this assignment, I had a vague idea of what I wanted to achieve. I wanted to create something resembling TV pixel noise, and I thought it would be a nice addition to have an eye in the centre of the piece to represent the eye watching the malfunctioning screen. I was interested in creating something that represents how I feel after a long day of staring at the screen. By the end of the day, my eyes are extremely tired and everything starts to seem blurry and confusing. I thought this artwork was a nice way of representing this idea.

## Process

- Firstly, I created the eye using the arc() function to create two arcs that came together to form the eye shape. Then I used the ellipse() function to create the pupil and other features of the eye

- Next, I use nested For loops to create the squares, which were drawn across and along the screen in regular intervals
- To achieve the glitching effect, I assigned each square a random colour, which changed after each loop was completed. The end result was very flashy, and my eyes are still sore from staring at it for too long
- I wanted the art piece to be interactive, so I decided to make the sqaures rotate depending on the location of the mouse. In order to do this, I had the learn how to use the rotateX() and rotateY() functions. I found out that I needed to add a third argument to setup() named 'P3D' in order for the effect to be visible. The end result was not what I expected it to be, but I did not make any changes because I liked how it looked
- I also coded the iris of the eye to change its colour randomly whenever someone clicked the mouse

## Challenges

- The part of this assignment that I struggled the most with was trying to get the squares to rotate, because I was unfamiliar with this prior to starting this assignment. But once I did research on how to properly use the function, I was able to use it in a nice way
- I struggled with using the arc() function for last week's assignment, but now that I am done with this assignment, I can confidently use it

## In conclusion

I really enjoyed completing this assignment, and I am excited to learn how to use several more functions to create art!
