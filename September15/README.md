# Week 1 Assignment: Creating a self-portrait using Processing

In order to create my self portrait, I used the functions: ellipse(), line(), triangle(), arc(), stroke(), fill(). I created the self-portrait with a more cartoonish approach rather than going down the realistic route. I aimed to create the main features of my face, such as my head, eyes, nose, mouth and hair.

The part of this assignment that I found the most difficult was creating the eyebrows, because I did not know what arguments to put into the arc() function to achieve the look I wanted. But after watching a video and going on the Processing website, I was able to figure this out. Creating my hair was also quite difficult. I used several circles overlapping each other to give the hair some texture.
