# Robot Maze

For my final project, I will be creating a robot vehicle controlled by buttons using arduino and Processing. My initial plan was to create a hidden maze, where the player will be unable to see the robot. However, after doing more research, I realised that this is too complex. Therefore, I decided to simplify my final project by removing the hidden aspect and creating a robot vehicle that will only be able to move when a series of questions are answered correctly on Processing.
